 created for ESFA reporisotries on 17th dec 2017.


Notes as of the 22nd Dec 2017 : - start --

- SoFA Section is completely automated -
- Balance Sheet Assets complete happy path , some of the pages have been finished for all scenarios.
            Started from the Cash page downwards for errors.

- Asset Under Construction Started Capital granst and Donations is done remaining.

- Created new Folders for VSTS repo : location |: ESFA_Repositories in Documents. In this the latest code resided for all the work.


- Created VSTS Repository with credentais emailed in vedaitconsuling email id.

- all working fine - check in and check out from single repo working fine for all the projects.

- Knowledge transfer session for Avi , Manjit and Andrew - Shared Head First Java Book.

- Start with Knowledge Transfer + Asset Under Construction.

- passwords : tablet is awadkar and Winterof18

- setup done in the new machine .


- To Do List :


        - Check the Access One class is still used and clean the code if not needed. I think it is incorporated in other classs.
        - javadoc comments needed in most Page Objects. Review that!
        - Readme needs to be completed.
        - Extent Reporter throwing NullPointer at loadXML in Hooks @After. This is happening when single Scenario or single Feature File is run
            as the call does not travel via the RunWith.java which holds the configuration command for the reporter to compile.
                tested in test framework code for handling the Null pointer when singular scenarios are run with a message.
